## Abstract

*The distinction between natural and anthropogenic seismic events represents an important task within the
field of geological observation and surveying. Historically, this task demanded considerable time and expertise,
necessitating the trained eye of experienced professionals. However, with the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), there emerges a promising prospect of possibly transferring this task to computers
entirely which could potentially enable better insight into natural seismic activity, thereby facilitating
more accurate predictions and proactive warning systems for future events. In this study, we explore and
compare two machine learning methodologies for the classification of seismic events: Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Principal Component Analysis combined with Support Vector Machines (PCASVM).
Although CNNs demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, their computational demands are
significantly higher. In contrast, PCA-SVM offers a computationally efficient solution with competitive
performance, making it a viable option for real-time applications. By analyzing these approaches, this work
provides a comprehensive framework for balancing accuracy and efficiency in seismic event classification,
laying the groundwork for future advancements in automated geological monitoring systems.
